# Speech Recognition Model

## Overview

This project implements a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for speech recognition using a Mel spectrogram as the input feature. The model utilizes a combination of CNN layers for feature extraction from audio data and LSTM layers to capture sequential dependencies in the audio for recognition. It is designed to predict letters (A-Z) from speech.

## Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `tensorflow`: For building and training the neural network model.
- `librosa`: For audio processing and extracting Mel spectrograms.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib`: For visualizing the Mel spectrogram.

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow librosa numpy matplotlib
Files
speech_recognition.py: The main Python script that processes audio data, builds the model, and trains the model on labeled speech data.

How to Use
Preprocess Audio File:
The function preprocess_audio(file_path) is used to load and preprocess an audio file. It converts the audio file into a Mel spectrogram, which is a suitable feature for training the model. The audio should be in .wav format, and it will be resampled to 16kHz.

Build the Model:
The build_model(input_shape) function creates a CNN-RNN hybrid model with:

CNN layers for feature extraction.

LSTM layers for sequential learning.

Dense layers for final prediction output.

Visualize Spectrogram:
The Mel spectrogram is visualized using matplotlib, providing insight into the audio data representation.

Train the Model:
Although the model is set up, you will need to provide labeled audio data to train the model. This dataset should consist of audio files representing each character in the alphabet, and the corresponding labels should be the characters (A-Z). The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss function, suitable for multi-class classification.

Example Usage
python

Edit
# Path to your audio file
audio_file = "path_to_audio.wav"  # Replace with an actual file path

# Preprocess the audio file
mel_spectrogram = preprocess_audio(audio_file)

# Build the model
input_shape = mel_spectrogram.shape + (1,)  # Add channel dimension
model = build_model(input_shape)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Visualize the Mel Spectrogram
plt.imshow(mel_spectrogram, cmap='viridis')
plt.title("Mel Spectrogram")
plt.show()

# Train the model with labeled data (example dataset needed)
# model.fit(training_data, training_labels, epochs=10)
Model Architecture
CNN Layers:

2 Conv2D layers with ReLU activation for feature extraction from the Mel spectrogram.

MaxPooling2D layers to reduce the dimensionality.

RNN Layers:

Two LSTM layers with 128 units each to capture sequential dependencies in the audio data.

Dense Layers:

A fully connected Dense layer with ReLU activation.

A final Dense layer with 26 output units (representing letters A-Z) and softmax activation for classification.

Next Steps
Train the model with a labeled dataset of speech samples to recognize spoken letters.

Experiment with different architectures (e.g., adding more layers or using GRU instead of LSTM) to improve accuracy.

Extend the model to handle entire words or phrases by using larger datasets and more complex architectures.
